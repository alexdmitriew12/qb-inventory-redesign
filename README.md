Hi, this is my second QB frontend edit. I added decay script to this inventory so if you want to work it properly you should download qb-decay from here: https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/qb-decay

Also some sentences can be translated to polish because i made this for my private server.

Enjoy to use!
